I also contribute in integrating the company's software with Intuit's Quickbook Java SDK for over a year now, working alone for a majority of the time. Currently at Dataforma, I have been doing research into Kubernetes (K8) and different deployment architectures for DevOps <br><br> During Fall 2021-2022, I served as a Computer Science Tutor at York College of Pennsylvania. I assisted students with their coding assignments and guided them to the appropriate solutions. I helped classes with 20+ students in a 101 class and provided nighttime tutoring for higher-level classes. <br><br>I also worked as a Simulation Tech at York College of Pennsylvania from Spring 2021-2022. Here, I was involved in providing technical and general support for the simulation program development used for healthcare training courses. I assisted with more than 10 simulations, ensuring everything was well set, functioning, and properly cleaned post-use."

As part of this journey, I'm exploring new ways to streamline and future-proof internal workflows. <br><br> Apart from my day-to-day work, I maintain a strong interest in self-hosting my own service stacks. This is driven by my passion for discovering new software applications that can enhance efficiency in both my personal and professional life. <br><br> I'm also always on the lookout for innovative frameworks to add to my arsenal, with a key goal of substantially enhancing user experiences. Ultimately, I believe in the importance of constant learning, delivering quality, and driving perpetual improvement in every aspect."

This empowers me to rely less on external services and push the boundaries of what's possible when you control the underlying systems. <br><br> I also find immense satisfaction in supporting my friends with their projects, offering advice and sharing insights from my own experiences. There's something really rewarding about being able to contribute to other people's success and seeing their ideas come to life. <br><br> Currently, my learning pathway has led me to Kubernetes and Sage software. As I delve deeper into Kubernetes, I am gaining valuable insights into container orchestration. Moreover, understanding Sage and other accounting software is not only enhancing my tech stack but also equipping me with a broader view of business operations."
